# Building Energy Geeks (formerly InverseBuilding)

This repository hosts a series of tutorials on how to solve various types of data analysis problems in building physics.

* Energy performance assessment
* Prediction of energy use
* HVAC monitoring and fault detection
* Material characterisation

As of the last update of this description (March 24th 2020), the repository has just been renamed Building Energy Geeks, and a nice page is under construction to display all tutorials. Stay tuned !

You can still view the former version of the website [here](http://srouchier.github.io/InverseBuilding/).

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.

You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo/.
